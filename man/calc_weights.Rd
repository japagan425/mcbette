\title{Calculate the weights for each marginal likelihood}
\usage{
calc_weights(marg_liks)
}
\arguments{
\item{marg_liks}{(non-log) marginal likelihood estimates}
}
\value{
the weight of each marginal likelihood estimate,
which will sum up to 1.0
}
\description{
Calculate the weights for each marginal likelihood
}
\examples{
library(testthat)

# Evidences (aka marginal likelihoods) can be very small
evidences <- c(0.0001, 0.0002, 0.0003, 0.0004)

# These are the weight we expect from these evidences
expected <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)

# Calculate the weights
created <- calc_weights(evidences)

expect_equal(created, expected)
expect_equal(sum(created), 1.0)
