## Introduction

![](mcbette_logo.png)

Given a DNA alignment, one wonders which phylogenetic inference model
fits that alignment best. `mcbette` ('Model Comparison using babette') 
can give the answer.

In this example, we use a 'BEAST2' example alignment and compare the fit
of two inference models on that alignment. We'll interpret the finding
in the end, concluding which inference model to use.

## Getting started

First, load `mcbette`:

```{r}
library(mcbette)
```

To use `mcbette`, BEAST2 and the BEAST2 `NS` package must be installed:

```{r}
tryCatch(
  mcbette_self_test()
)
```

If you've just gotten a message that you need to install either
BEAST2 or the BEAST2 NS package, do so. The rest of this
vignette will be empty.

## Method

To run `mcbette`, we need a FASTA file with a DNA alignment in it.
We use one that is present in the `mcbette` package:

```{r}
fasta_filename <- system.file("extdata", "primates.fas", package = "mcbette")
```

Now we have the alignment saved in our FASTA file, we can display it:

```{r}
alignment <- ape::read.FASTA(fasta_filename)
image(alignment)
```

From that alignment, get the marginal likelihood of two inference models,
only differing in their nucleotide substitution model:

  1. JC69: all nucleotides share the same mutation rate. 
     For example, the
     mutation rate from adenine to cytosine is the same as the
     mutation rate from guanine to thymine
  2. GTR: there is a different mutation rate from each nucleotide to each
     other nucleotide

```{r}
if (can_run_mcbette()) {
  inference_model_1 <- beautier::create_test_ns_inference_model(
    site_model = beautier::create_jc69_site_model()   
  )
  inference_model_2 <- beautier::create_test_ns_inference_model(
    site_model = beautier::create_gtr_site_model()   
  )
  inference_models <- c(list(inference_model_1), list(inference_model_2))
  
  df <- est_marg_liks(
    fasta_filename = fasta_filename, 
    inference_models = inference_models
  )
  knitr::kable(df)
}
```

The Bayes factor (usually denoted as K) can be used for model comparison. 
It can be calculated from the marginal likelihoods ratio:

```{r}
if (can_run_mcbette()) {
  marg_lik_jc <- exp(Rmpfr::mpfr(df$marg_log_lik[1], 512))
  marg_lik_gtr <- exp(Rmpfr::mpfr(df$marg_log_lik[2], 512))
  bayes_factor <- marg_lik_jc / marg_lik_gtr
  interpretation <- interpret_bayes_factor(as.numeric(bayes_factor))
  cat(paste("Interpretation from JC69 model's point of view: ", interpretation))
}
```
